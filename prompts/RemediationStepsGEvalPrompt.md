# Remediation Steps G-Eval Prompt

```text
You will be shown an AI-generated JSON insight enclosed in the <insight></insight> tags containing two fields: `investigation_summary` and `remediation_steps`.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of `remediation_steps` and classify the insight into one of the following categories: [Good, Needs Improvement, Bad].

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

* Evaluation criterion:

- For PHP FPM-related issues (like OOM due to memory spikes), does the insight properly identify processes using commands like `ps aux | grep php-fpm` or `htop`?
- The insight should not recommend users to directly view or edit the configuration files like `fpm-pool.conf`, Varnish `.vcl`, Elasticsearch `jvm.options` files. Instead it should guide the users to the relevant UI sections. And suggest contacting hashlify support for further investigation and resolution of the issue. However if the insight is suggesting the users to contact hashlify support for viewing or editing the configuration files then it should be classified as Good.
- It must not recommend restarting services (PHP FPM, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Varnish) using systemctl or CLI. It should instead guide users to the **Manage Services** section in the UI.
- The insight should not suggest customers to stop MySQL (MariaDB) service as it is the database service and cannot be stopped by anyone. Also the insight can only suggest stopping the Varnish, Redis, and New Relic Services and that too only from the **Server > Manage Services** section from the UI and not via direct CLI over SSH in case the issue resolution depends on stopping these services.
- No misleading or impossible actions from the client end (e.g., stopping MySQL service, modifying debian-sys-maint settings, adjusting attributes like `pm.max_children`, `-Xms`, `-Xmx`, `output_buffering`, changing configuration files from the `etc/**/*.*` directory via SSH etc). Instead the insight should recommend the client to contact hashlify support for issue resolution.
- Does not suggest installing unrelated external services (e.g., Elasticsearch when the issue is PHP FPM-related).
- All suggestions should follow the UI paths and support hashlify procedures.
- The insight should not suggest modifying any file(s) / folder(s) except from the `public_html`, `private_html`, `<application_identifier>/tmp` folders via CLI over SSH. The user can only edit files in the mentioned three folders via CLI over SSH. (The <application_identifier> is unique identifier for each user's application (like `zwtafadysi`, `agfvcbysir`))
- If the insight contains suggestions of editing or updating files in the `public_html`, `private_html`, `<application_identifier>/tmp` folders like `cat /home/35219.hashlifystagingapps.com/pkvetxqpzb/public_html/wp-content/debug.log`, `nano /home/35219.hashlifystagingapps.com/pkvetxqpzb/public_html/wp-config.php` essentially any files in the `public_html` folder with path like `/home/<server_url>/<application_identifier>/public_html/**/*.*`, `private_html` folder with path like `/home/<server_url>/<application_identifier>/private_html/**/*.*` and `tmp` folder with path like `/home/<server_url>/<application_identifier>/tmp/*.*` then for all such files the insight should recommend editing or updating these files via CLI through SSH instead of suggesting the users to edit/update these files via UI as files in these three folders can only be updated via SSH. 
- Does not recommend installing 3rd-party WordPress plugins.
- If cron jobs are involved, they should be created using the **Cron Management** tab in the UI (not external cron tools).
- If large files/folders are recommended for deletion, the insight must:
  - Recommend taking a local backup before deletion.
  - Suggest horizontal/vertical scaling if the user chooses not to delete them.
- Avoids mentioning unrelated stack components. E.g., doesn't mix Laravel log issues with WordPress configs.
- If the issue is due to large logs or disk saturation:
  - Insight should recommend **Disk Cleanup** from UI (`Settings & Packages > Optimization`) and NOT deletion via SSH.
  - If a service is down due to full disk, remediation must include which files/folders are consuming the most space.
- No false/misleading remediations (e.g., suggesting bot blocking when there's minimal bot activity, Redis config changes for MariaDB issues, etc.).
- Should NOT recommend features/tools deprecated or not supported by hashlify (e.g. Bot Protection).
- If the insight relates to a specific application, it must mention the **application identifier**.
- The insight should not suggest the user to view or modify the following files: 
    - '/var/log/apache2'
    - '/var/log/chrony'
    - '/var/log/imunify360'
    - '/var/log/mysql'
    - '/var/log/private'
    - '/var/log/redis'
    - '/var/log/unattended-upgrades'
    - '/var/log/varnish'
- If it highlights a DDoS risk:
  - The IPs listed in the remediation must match those in the investigation.
  - Only malicious IPs should be mentioned, not legit user or bot IPs.
  - It must not recommend blocking legitimate bots (e.g., Google or Bing bots).

Format the output as JSON with the following keys:
classification: "One of: Good | Needs Improvement | Bad",
justification: "Explain which criteria were satisfied or violated."

* Evaluation Steps: 

1. Assess whether the remediation is directly tied to the problem identified in the investigation_summary. For example, if investigation failed due to SSH issues, suggesting a PHP config change is irrelevant.
2. Check whether all recommendations: refer to UI-based paths for restarts (e.g., Manage Services) and avoid forbidden actions such as systemctl restart, stopping MySQL, or editing files in protected directories.
3. Ensure that actions like file modification are only recommended within public_html, private_html, and <app_id>/tmp via SSH CLI only â€” never via UI for these folders.
4. Verify that no unsupported plugins (e.g., WordPress security tools) or deprecated features (e.g., Bot Protection) are recommended.
5. Ensure no misleading remediations are included i.e no generic advice like "block bots" unless command logs show bot-related spikes and no incorrect file or process suggestions.
6. If disk space is the issue, check for: 
    - Recommendation of Disk Cleanup via UI, not manual deletion via SSH.
    - Backup instructions before deletion. 
    - Optional scaling suggestions if user doesn't want to delete.
7. Confirm whether the remediation mentions the application identifier if it's app-specific (e.g., path references, logs).
8. If remediation includes IP bans then IPs must match those identified in investigation abd must not suggest blocking bots like Google or Bing and distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic.
9. Ensure that cron jobs must be recommended via the Cron Management UI. Redis, Varnish, New Relic: Only stoppable via UI, never via CLI.
10. Finally check for:
    - Clear language and UI navigation.
    - No irreversible or risky recommendations.
    - Escalation to hashlify Support where appropriate.
